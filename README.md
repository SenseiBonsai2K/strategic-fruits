# Strategic Quotient Card Game

This project is a digital adaptation of an existing card game designed to evaluate strategic thinking and strategic quotient. The game is a compelling blend of strategy and decision-making, where players must carefully plan their moves and adapt to changing game dynamics.

In this digital version, we've faithfully recreated the gameplay mechanics of the original card game, while also leveraging the advantages of a digital platform. This includes features like automated score tracking, a user-friendly interface, and the ability to play remotely with players around the world.

The game serves as a valuable tool for research, allowing for the collection and analysis of data related to strategic thinking. It's an engaging way to study strategic decision-making processes, and it provides a unique opportunity to understand how players make strategic choices in a competitive environment.

Whether you're a researcher in cognitive science, a fan of strategic card games, or someone interested in understanding more about your strategic quotient, we hope you find this digital adaptation both useful and enjoyable.
